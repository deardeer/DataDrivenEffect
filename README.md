## Marching Ants


#####  <span style="color:blue">marchingAnt ([Path], [Ant], Interval, Gap, Shape [,Groupid, Color, AntModal, IstheOne, IsLast]) </span>
Constructs a new effect of Ant with the settings. 

[A demo is given in ./example/marchingant/]

###### Parameters
- The Path is an array of dots composed of the path that the ant marches defined by users, for instance, using a line represent the path of ant marching

	  e.g.,
	  Path = [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], where [x_i, y_i] is the dot position
  
- The Ant is an array of dots which compose the shape (visual proxity) of ant defined by users
	
	  e.g.,
	  Ant = [[x1,y1], [x2,y2], [x3,y3]], where ant is marching with a shape of a triangle, the Ant is the array of dots of triangle. 

- The Interval is the speed that the ant marches, its value is in the range[10, 30], the smaller the Interval is, the faster the ant marches. 



- The Gap is the distance between every two ants, its value is in the range[10ï¼Œ30], the bigger the Gap is, the sparser ants are from each other. 


- If Color is specifying, it represents the color of ant. 


 	 e.g., Color = "#aabbcc"

- The Groupid represents the groups of ants in common fate. That is, if two or more ants are the same Groupid, the Interval or Gap of these ants will change simutanouesly when modifying the Interval or Gap. 

- The AntModal represents that the effect is not defined by a JSON file.(Maybe the user defines the effect by themselves). If the effect of Ant is only one path, the AntModal don't have to be defined. The AntModal has relationship with parameters IstheOne and IsLast.
	
eg., AntModal = path1

		var antDots = [[110,387],[129,399],[110,393],[91,400],[110,387]]
		var path1 = new Path();
		for(var i = 0; i < liDot.length; i ++){
		    path1.add(new Point(liDot[i]))
		  	path1.closed = closed;
		}
		

- The IstheOne and IsLast are to handle the construction of marchingants when the user define more than one ant. When you loop through your Ants and add effect of marchingants for them, you should set IstheOne to "true" when you loop first time, otherwise set it "false" and set IsLast to "true" when it loop the last time.      

	eg., 

			var liGroupId = Object.keys(allGroupMap)
            for(var i = 0; i < liGroupId.length; i ++){
            	if(i == 0){
                	theoneflag = true;
                }
                else{
                    theoneflag = false;
                }
                if(i == liGroupId.length-1){
                    thelastflag = true;
                }
				marchingAnt4(path, ant, interval, gap, groupId, color, antModal, theoneflag, thelastflag)
			}

##### <span style="color:blue"> loadMA (fileName [, canvasId]) </span>
Constructs a new effect of Ant on the basis of the content in JSON file user defined.

[A demo is given in ./example/circos.html]

###### Parameters
- fileName: the JSON file which configures the information of ants you want to load. 

	e.g., fileName = "circos.json"

	Below is the content of JSON file.

	                    }]
	            }}
	    }

  
	where "name" represents the name of the effect, "magroups" holds multiple Marching Ants effects. Each one is indexed by a unique id (e.g., "orange" here), and two decriptive information "mainfo" and "malist". "mainfo" stored the non-geometric information of the ant, such as color, groupid, gap. "malist" defines the geometry information, i.e., "path", "ant" and "boundary".


- canvasId: the id of the canvas on which Dynamic Effect to be rendered. If canvas is undefined, a 800x800 canvas will be created.

	e.g., canvasId = "aecanvas"


## Geometric Deformation



## Gradual Appearance

#####  <span style="color:blue">gradualAppearance (Visual_Proxy, Offset, Repetition, Speed) </span>
Constructs a new effect of GD(gradual appearance) with the settings. 

[A demo is given in ./example/gradualappearance]

###### Parameters
- The Visual_Proxy is the element of which you want to add the effect of gradual appearance, it should be a SVG element, such as the circle elements drawn with D3.

	e.g., Visual_Proxy = circle

		(cirlce = d3.select("svg")
					.append("circle")
					.attr("cx",50)
					.attr("cy",60)
					.attr("r",30)
		)

- The Offset is the time the effect of gradual appearance appears.The unit is seconds.

	e.g., Offset = 3

- The Repetition is the number of times the effect of gradual appearance occurs.

	e.g., Repetition = 4

- The Speed indicates how fast the effect of gradual appearance changes.

	e.g., Speed = 5
